# LaughTrack

We all want to be better comedians - but we're creatives. How are we supposed to keep track of all of our jokes, events and connections in the comedy world? I am not an _accountant_ or don't _own_ a _planner._ Well that's exactly what we at Laugh Track are helping you to figure out.

Laugh Track is your all in one bit diary, joke improver, connection creating powerhouse. Journal and improve your best jokes with a whole community behind you. Upload your performances to get tips on why wearing a baseball cap under stage lights is a bad idea. Check out all of the local events so you can try out that super niche bit you've been workshopping about  You'll be the Nate Bargatze of your local comedy scene in no time.

Laugh Track - so you'll never need one
